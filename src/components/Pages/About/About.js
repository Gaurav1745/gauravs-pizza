                    No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom to choose your toppings - from paneer, crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn, black olives, fresh tomato, red paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri chicken, grilled chicken rasher, chicken sausage or chicken tikka- the options are almost endless, anything and everything you can think of that too on top of the crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin crust, cheese burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan pizza. Because just like a pizza, Pizza Man understands you.

Time it if you please. With 1250+ stores present all over India, you can have a Pizza Man pizza even while traveling on a train. Yes, you are reading it right, you can enjoy pizza on train too.

                    So stop googling for the “pizza shops near me” and order from your nearest pizza outlet to have a hot box of pizza on your table in the next 30 minutes, or berth at the next halting station.
